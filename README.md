DIC - By NamelessGod

I recently got my discord account hijacked by some French guy and after further analysis, he got access to my discord by modifying some of the discord js files.
Using a webhook, he was able to grab my token and my username and send it directly to his server.
To never have to deal with a malware that would do the same thing, I created this small program that goes though the js files and reports/deletes any line with webhook.

I would recommand disabling the automatic launch of Discord and let DIC start discord by itself

Enjoy!
